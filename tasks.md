## Tasks To Do

### 1. Literature Review
- [ ] Identify and read recent research papers.
- [ ] Summarize key findings from related work.
- [ ] Analyze gaps in existing studies.

### 2. Data Preparation
- [ ] Collect relevant datasets (e.g., ADNI, other public datasets).
- [ ] Preprocess data (e.g., handle missing values, normalization).
- [ ] Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights.

### 3. Model Development
- [ ] Replicate existing high-performing models.
- [ ] Test alternative feature engineering techniques.
- [ ] Implement custom architecture or innovative methods.
- [ ] Ensure reproducibility with robust pipelines.

### 4. Evaluation & Validation
- [ ] Define performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).
- [ ] Perform cross-validation to check model generalizability.
- [ ] Compare new results against state-of-the-art models.

### 5. Documentation
- [ ] Document the entire process (code, decisions, experiments).
- [ ] Prepare visuals (graphs, tables) for final presentation.
- [ ] Draft the thesis/report.

### 6. Other
- [ ] Collaborate with peers/mentors for feedback.
- [ ] Plan for publication (if applicable).
